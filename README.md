## directoryBackup

I don't really know what I am doing. But I would like to make a windows GUI application to backup selected folders to a remote file storage.
Possible make this process automated in the background after. Because windows file history is junk, and the other windows backup refuses to 
connect to my personal storage server for some unknown reason.

Also, I am programming this in a linux environment for Windows.. so that is an extra hastle. Just ignore my bad code.
